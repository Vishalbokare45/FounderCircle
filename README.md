I developed a MERN stack platform specifically designed for entrepreneurs to share startup ideas, build professional networks, and collaborate on business ventures.
It combines the networking aspects of LinkedIn with the idea-sharing culture of startup communities, while providing integrated services to help turn concepts into reality.
